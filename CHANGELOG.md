## 1.10.2

- Fix: expose x start/end and y start/end for horizontal and vertical line annotations.
- Fix: ensure KDBush worker works in prod build

## 1.10.1

- Fix: ensure single annotations render properly ([#187](https://github.com/flekschas/regl-scatterplot/issues/187))

## 1.10.0

- Feat: add support for annotations via `scatterplot.drawAnnotations()`

## 1.9.6

- Fix: try ensure `zoomToArea` works in cases where `aspectRatio` is not equal to `1` and add tests to verify this

## 1.9.5

- Fix: option types of `zoomToLocation`, `zoomToOrigin`, `zoomToArea`
- Fix: ensure `zoomToArea` works in cases where `aspectRatio` is not equal to `1`

## 1.9.4

- Fix: `scatterplot.draw(newPoints, { preventFilterReset })` should preserves the filter ([Jupyter-Scatter#134](https://github.com/flekschas/jupyter-scatter/issues/134))
- Fix: `scatterplot.hover(filteredOutPoint)` should not trigger a hover event

## 1.9.3

- Fix: point connection initial color map
- Fix: allow point connection color to be set to `inherit` (to inherit the point color)

## 1.9.2

- Fix: update `regl-line` to include a critical bug fix related to drawing connected points.

## 1.9.1

- Fix: add missing type definition for `scatterplot.get('spatialIndex')` ([#179](https://github.com/flekschas/regl-scatterplot/issues/179))

## 1.9.0

- Add: allow to retrieve KDBush's spatial index via `scatterplot.get('spatialIndex')`. The index refers to KDBush v4.0.2.
- Add: allow to pass a spatial index to `scatterplot.draw(newPoints, { spatialIndex })` to circumvent the indexing of `newPoints`. This can be useful when only the z or w coordinates of `newPoints` differ to previously drawn points or when you've computed the spatial index upfront.
- Add: run the computation of the spatial index in a worker when the number of points is larger or equal to one million. This behavior can be adjusted during the instantiation of the scatterplot via `createScatterplot({ spatialIndexUseWorker })`. If `true`, regl-scatterplot will always compute the spatial index in a worker. If `false`, regl-scatterplot will always compute the spatial index in the main browser thread.
- Add: export `createSpatialIndex` to allow creating a spatial index upfront conveniently
- Add: new `drawing` event that is _always fired synchronously_ before the end of a draw call. This event is useful for drawing other things as part of an animation frame. The main difference to the default `draw` event is that the `draw` event is fired asynchronously (like all other events) after the draw call such that the draw call itself isn't blocked.
- Fix: pass `{ camera, view, xScale, yScale }` as the payload of the `draw` event as specified in the docs.
- Fix: allow `scatterplot.set({ showPointConnections: true })` before points were drawn [#171](https://github.com/flekschas/regl-scatterplot/issues/171)
- Fix: pub-sub related types by updating `pub-sub-es` to version 3

## 1.8.5

- Fix: add `d3-scale` types as a dev dependency [#153](https://github.com/flekschas/regl-scatterplot/issues/153)
- Fix: run CI workflows on Ubuntu to ensure the `sed` replacement call works properly [#153](https://github.com/flekschas/regl-scatterplot/issues/153)

## 1.8.4

- Fix a regression with the point opacity introduced in [v1.7.1](#1.7.1)

## 1.8.3

## 1.8.2

- Improve hover detection

## 1.8.1

- Fix: add ability to set `aspectRatio` in the constructor
- Fix: add missing type definition for `aspectRatio`
- Fix: extend `opacity` type to correctly allow `number[]`

## 1.8.0

- Add `scatterplot.getScreenPosition(pointIdx)` to retrieve the screen position of a point by its index.

## 1.7.1

- Improve data type inference of the z/w values and allow to explicitely specify their data type via `draw(newPoints, { zDataType: 'categorical', wDataType: 'continuous' })`

## 1.7.0

- Add `preventFilterReset` option to `draw()` to allow re-drawing while keeping the current point filter. [#136](https://github.com/flekschas/regl-scatterplot/pull/136)
- Add ability to hover, select, and filter points immediately when calling `draw(points, { hover: 0, select: [1, 2], filter: [0, 2, 3] })`. Immediately hovering, selecting, or filtering points avoids a filter that can occur when first drawing points and then hovering, selecting, or filtering points subsequently. [#142](https://github.com/flekschas/regl-scatterplot/pull/142)
- Add missing `filteredPoints` type definition. [#139](https://github.com/flekschas/regl-scatterplot/pull/139)
- Add missing `selectedPoints` type definition.
- Fix drawing a single connecting line between points [#125](https://github.com/flekschas/regl-scatterplot/issues/125)
- Fix drawing a single point connection [#141](https://github.com/flekschas/regl-scatterplot/pull/141)
- Fix `draw()`'s promise resolution when `showPointConnections` is `true`. The promise is now resolved after both, the points and point connections, have been drawn.
- Set minimum Node version to `16` and minimum npm version to `7`. You might still be able to use `regl-scatterplot` with older version but it's not advised.

## 1.6.10

- Fix `scatterplot.destroy()` to properly remove all event listeners bound during instance creation. [#135](https://github.com/flekschas/regl-scatterplot/pull/135)

## v1.6.9

- Fix empty `select([])` handling [#132](https://github.com/flekschas/regl-scatterplot/issues/132)

## v1.6.8

- Fix `filter()` to allow filtering out all points [#122](https://github.com/flekschas/regl-scatterplot/issues/122)

## v1.6.5

- Fix typing issue related to `subscribe()` ([#117](https://github.com/flekschas/regl-scatterplot/issues/117))

## v1.6.4

- Improve lasso on long press start

## v1.6.2

- Fix a build regression from updating to Rollup v3

## v1.6.1

- Update third party libraries
- Improve lasso long press indicator styling
- Fix an issue where a lasso with less than three control points

## v1.6.0

- Add the ability to filter down points via `scatterplot.filter(pointIdxs)`. This can be useful if you need to temporarily need to hide points without having to re-instantiate the regl-scatterplot instance. E.g., when calling `scatterplot.filter([0, 1, 2])`, only the first, second, and third point will remain visible. All other points (and their related point connections) will be visually and interactively hidden.

  To reset the filter call `scatterplot.unfilter()` or `scatterplot.filter([])`.

  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/932103/222810324-3e048176-fd1d-4ede-a836-511c548f09ff.mp4

- Add the ability to retrieve selected and filtered point indices via `scatterplot.get('selectedPoints')` and `scatterplot.get('filteredPoints')` respectively.

## v1.5.1

- Refactor lasso manager to support SSR ([#101](https://github.com/flekschas/regl-scatterplot/issues/101))
- Fix a glitch where the scatterplot instance is destroyed after a `scatterplot.draw()` was called but before `scatterplot.draw()` finished. ([#101](https://github.com/flekschas/regl-scatterplot/issues/101))

## v1.5.0

- Add the ability to lasso select point upon long press via `scatterplot.set('lassoOnLongPress', true)`.
- Fix type issues ([#98](https://github.com/flekschas/regl-scatterplot/issues/98))

## v1.4.2

- Enforce the canvas width and height to be at least 1px to prevent view operations from breaking.

## v1.4.1

- Bump `dom-2d-camera` to publish view updates on camera tweens ([#95](https://github.com/flekschas/regl-scatterplot/issues/95))

## v1.4.0

- Add zooming via the following four methods. All four methods supported animated transition just like `draw()`.
  1. `scatterplot.zoomToLocation(target, distance)` for zooming to a specific point location
  2. `scatterplot.zoomToArea(rectangle)` for zooming to an area specified by a rectangular bounding box
  3. `scatterplot.zoomToPoints(pointIndices)` for zooming to a set of points
  4. `scatterplot.zoomToOrigin()` for zooming to the origin

## v1.3.2

- Add `scatterplot.isSupported` and `renderer.isSupported` as read-only properties to expose if all GL extensions are supported and enabled in the user's browser (#90)
- Add `checkSupport()` as a globally exported function for users to check if their browser supports and has enabled all required GL extensions (#90)

## v1.3.1

- Add a missing `select` event name to the type definition (#87)

## v1.3.0

- Add properties `opacityInactiveScale` and `opacityInactiveMax` to enable de-emphasizing unselected points and highlight selected points. The final point opacity is now set to `min(opacityInactiveMax, currentOpacity) * opacityInactiveScale` when at least one point is selected. By default `opacityInactiveScale` and `opacityInactiveMax` are set to `1`. I.e., the default behavior did not change.

## v1.2.3

- Properly initialize new x/y scales upon calling `set()`

## v1.2.2

- Fix a minor issue in `destroy()` that prevented disconnecting resize listeners

## v1.2.1

- Update dom-2d-camera to fix internal tests

## v1.2.0

- Outsource WebGL renderer to improve instancing: You can now use a single shared WebGL renderer (via `createRenderer()`) to power multiple scatter plot instances. See https://flekschas.github.io/regl-scatterplot/multiple-instances.html.
- Add `scatterplot.redraw()` to enforce a redrawing of the scene. This can be necessary when you manually updated the camera.
- Add `scatterplot.view(cameraView, { preventEvent })` as a shorthand for setting the scatter plot's camera view. The `preventEvent` option enables synchronizing multiple scatter plot instances. See https://flekschas.github.io/regl-scatterplot/multiple-instances.html.
- Allow passing typed arrays to `scatterplot.draw({ x, y, z, w })`.

**Breaking changes:**

- `scatterplot.export()` is now returning an [ImageData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ImageData) object for better utility.

## v1.1.1

- Fix incorrect opacity handling (#74)

## v1.1.0

- Add `scatterplot.get('pointsInView')` to retrieve the indices of the points currently visible within the view (#72). Shoutout to [@dulex123](https://github.com/dulex123) for his PR!
- Add `scatterplot.get('points')` to retrieve all currently drawn points.
- Add an example for demonstrating how labels can be rendered. The demo using `scatterplot.get('pointsInView')` to determine when to render text labels. See https://flekschas.github.io/regl-scatterplot/text-labels.html

## v1.0.0

Woohoo 🥳 It's time to release v1! Nothing dramatic changed in this release but I felt that the library/API is now stable enough. Also, a big shoutout to [@manzt](https://github.com/manzt) and [@japrescott](https://github.com/japrescott) for their PRs.

- Support drawing columnar data `scatterplot.draw({ x: [...], y: [...], ... })` (#59)
- Fix the rendering issue with with Safari 14 (#45)
- Replace webpack with vite (#64)

- Update regl-line to be compatible with regl v2

## v0.19.0

- Ensure inter buffers and viewports are properly updated on every draw call.

**Breaking changes:**

- Improve the handling of the connection order by switching from a structured 5th component to a 6th component.

  Previously to provide a specific order, the 5th component had to be a tuple of `[lineComponentId, orderIndex]`. With this update the 5th component will always just be `lineComponentId` and the 6th will be `orderIndex`.

## v0.18.7

- Avoid text selection when lassoing

## v0.18.6

- Optimize density-based opacity encoding

## v0.18.5

  [dynamic-opacity.html](https://flekschas.github.io/regl-scatterplot/dynamic-opacity.html) for an example.

## v0.17.1

- Add [`scatterplot.export`](README.md#scatterplot.export) for exporting the current view as pixels.
- Add default canvas width/height (`'auto'`) to fix an issue on high-dpi monitors that do not style the canvas element (#41)
- Add resize handler so when width/height is set to `'auto'` the canvas element is automatically resized on `resize` and `orientationchange` events.
- Improve framebuffer rendering and add `gamma` prop to allow controlling the opacity blending (#42)

## v0.17.0

- Add the ability to color point connections by their segment via `pointConnectionColorBy: 'segment'`
- Fix an issue with normalizing RGB(A) values
- Avoid the unnecessary use of the logical-assignment-operators (#39)

## v0.16.2

- Avoid empty lasso events
- Fix incorrectly initialized `pointConnectionColorBy`, `pointConnectionOpacityBy`, and `pointConnectionSizeBy`
- Fix an issue with the color conversion to RGBA
- Fix an issue blurring an active point connection

## v0.16.1

- Allow inheriting `pointConnectionColor` from `pointColor` by setting `pointConnectionColor: 'inherit'`. Same for `pointConnectionColorActive` and `pointConnectionColorHover`.
- Fix incorrectly initialized `opacity`
- Fix incorrectly initialized `colorBy`, `opacityBy`, and `sizeBy`
- Fix not assigned `pointConnectionOpacity`
- Rename `pointConnectionOpacitySelection` and `pointConnectionSizeSelected` to `pointConnectionOpacityActive` and `pointConnectionSizeActive` for consistency

## v0.16.0

- Allow the point-associated data values to be either categorical or continuous instead of enforcing one to be categorical and the other one to be continuous. For continuous data, assign [0,1]-normalized data as the third or forth component of a point. For categorical data, assign an integer-based data. For instance, if a point looks `[1, 2, 3, 4]` we assume that the first (`3`) and second (`4`) data value is categorical. If you would instead have points like `[1, 2, 0.33, 0.44]` where the third and forth component are within [0,1] then we would assume that those components represent continuous data. For backward compatibility, `colorBy: 'category'` refers to coloring by the third component and `colorBy 'value'` refers to the forth component. Additionall, you can now reference the third components via `value1`, `valueA`, `valueZ`, or `z` and the forth component via`value2`, `valueB`, `valueW`, or `w`.

- Add the ability to connect points visually via `draw(points, { connectPoints: true })`. This assumes that your points have a 5th component that identifies the point connection. Currently the order of points as they appear in `points` defines the order of how they would be connected. So assuming you have:

  ```javascript
  // prettier-ignore
  scatterplot.draw([
    1, 1, 0, 0, 0,
    2, 2, 0, 0, 0,
    3, 3, 0, 0, 1,
    4, 4, 0, 0, 1,
    5, 5, 0, 0, 0,
  ], { connectPoints: true });
  ```

  Then we would connext the points as follows:

  ```
  1 -> 2 -> 5
  3 -> 4
  ```

  For an example see [example/connected-points.js](example/connected-points.js).

- Add support for multi-selections by holding down <kbd>CMD</kbd> (by default) during click- or lasso-selections. The modifier key for multi-selections can be adjusted via `scatterplot.set({ keyMap: { merge: 'ctrl' } })`
- Add `performanceMode` to allow drawing up to 20 million points
- Add `opacityBy` to allow encoding one of the two data properties as the point opacity.

- Fix an issue with the point size between devices with different pixel ratios
- Fix an issue with detecting points when using variable point sizes
- Fix an issue that drew the background image before it was loaded

**Breaking changes:**

- Removed the following deplicated properties:
  - `background` (use `backgroundColor` instead)
  - `distance` (use `cameraDistance` instead)
  - `rotation` (use `cameraRotation` instead)
  - `target` (use `cameraTarget` instead)
  - `view` (use `cameraView` instead)

## v0.15.1

- Make sure the `keyMap` is properly initiated.
- Fix a memory leak by properly destroying the camera on `scatterplot.destroy()`.

## v0.15.0

- Add `mouseMode` for switching betweem mouse modes programmatically. Currently supported modes are `panZoom`, `lasso`, and `rotate`.
- Add `keyMap` for remapping modifier key-induced actions. Available modifier keys are `alt`, `shift`, `ctrl`, `cmd`, and `meta`. Available actions are `lasso` and `rotate`.
- Add `lassoInitiator` (boolean) for enabling a way to lasso points without having to use a modifier key. When activated, you can click into the void and a circle will appear. You can then start lassoing by mousing down + holding onto the circle and dragging. Since clicking into the void can be challenging when working with many points you can also long clicking anywhere and the circle for initiating the lasso will appear anywhere.
- Improve point selection

## v0.14.0

- Add `lassoStart`, `lassoExtend`, and `lassoEnd` events

**Breaking changes:**

- Renamed event `background-image-ready` to `backgroundImageReady` for consistency
- Switched to asynchronously broadcasted events to decouple regl-scatterplot's execution flow from the event handler. You can switch back to the old behavior if you like by initializing the scatterplot via `createScatterplot({ syncEvents: true })`

## v0.13.0

- Add support for transitioning points via `scatterplot.draw(updatedPoints, { transition: true})`
- Add support for size encoding the points' category or value via `scatterplot.set({ sizeBy })`

## v0.7.2

- Provide proper ESM instead of pointing to the source code.

## v0.7.1

- Replaced `hover` event with `pointover` and `pointout` to be able to know when a point is not hovered anymore.

## v0.7.0

- Allow changing the lasso smoothness via `set({ lassoMinDelay, lassoMinDist })` where `lassoMinDelay` is the minimum number of milliseconds between mousemove events before the lasso is extended and `lassoMinDist` is the minimum number of pixels the mouse has to move.

## v0.6.0

- Simplify API: `style()`, `attr()`, `scatterplot.canvas`, `scatterplot.regl`, and `scatterplot.version` are merged into `get()` and `set()`. The function signature is identical to `style()` and `attr()` so all you have to do is rename.
- Add recticle. It's not shown by default but can be activated with `set({ showRecticle, recticleColor })`.
- Fix a regression that caused interrupted panning

## v0.5.1
